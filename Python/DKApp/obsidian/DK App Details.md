DK App is a to be a multiplatform tool for me and my partner to use to keep up to date with things like groceries, TODOs, schedules, budgets, and more.

Right now the git repo just has the files for the webserver side of it.  I will likely need to reorganize the directories to add the projects for the mobile and website app side of things.
